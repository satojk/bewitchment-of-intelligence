# bewitchment-of-intelligence
“Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.”

Experiment 1: Baseline, Abridged BiDAF as given in starter code.

Experiment 2: Abridged BiDAF with TPR layer in place of the Encoder layer

Experiment 3: Abridged BiDAF with TPR layer in place of the Modeling layer

Experiment 4: Abridged BiDAF with TPR layer in place of both the Encoder and the Modeling layer

4 More experiments: the same as above, but with the original BiDAF (with 
        character-level encoding) instead of the abridged BiDAF

4 More experiments: the previous 4, but with some grammatical tag (spaCy POS?)
